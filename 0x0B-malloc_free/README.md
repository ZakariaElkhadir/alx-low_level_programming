What is malloc?

malloc stands for "memory allocation." It is a standard library function in C and C++ used to allocate a block of memory from the heap. The allocated memory can be used to store data structures, arrays, or any other objects.
What is free?

free is a function used to deallocate memory that was previously allocated with malloc (or related functions like calloc and realloc). Properly using free is essential to prevent memory leaks in your programs.
