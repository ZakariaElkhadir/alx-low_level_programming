## Introduction

Search algorithms are a critical component of computer science, used to find specific data within a dataset. Efficient search algorithms can significantly improve the performance of software applications, especially those that handle large datasets. This repository focuses on implementing various search algorithms in C, providing a foundation for understanding and applying these algorithms in real-world applications.

## Search Algorithms

### Binary Search

- **Description**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that efficiently searches for a target value within a sorted array.
- **Complexity**: O(log(n))

### Interpolation Search

- **Description**: An improved version of binary search that works on uniformly distributed data. It estimates the position of the target value based on the values of the data points.
- **Complexity**: O(n) or O(log(log(n))) with uniform input

### Ternary Search

- **Description**: Similar to binary search but divides the search space into three parts instead of two. It is particularly effective for searching in a sorted array of real numbers.
- **Complexity**: O(log(n))
