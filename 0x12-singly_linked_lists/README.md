Linked lists, on the other hand, are a sequence of nodes, each of which contains a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list. Linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position in the list, as only the nodes that need to be updated need to be modified. Linked lists are also useful when working with dynamic memory allocation, as nodes can be allocated and deallocated individually.
